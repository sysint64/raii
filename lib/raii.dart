/// Core library providing RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern implementation
/// for Dart/Flutter applications.
///
/// This library provides a foundation for managing object lifecycles through a systematic
/// approach to resource initialization and cleanup. It implements the RAII pattern,
/// ensuring that resources are properly managed throughout their lifetime.
///
/// The library follows these core principles:
/// - Explicit lifecycle management through clear interfaces
/// - Hierarchical resource management where parent objects manage their children
/// - Automatic cleanup of resources when they're no longer needed
///
/// **Basic usage:**
///
/// ```dart
/// // Create a lifecycle container
/// final raiiManager = RaiiManager();
///
/// // Wrap a resource that needs lifecycle management
/// final resource = RaiiBox.withLifecycle(
///   raiiManager,
///   instance: MyResource(),
///   init: (r) => r.initialize(),
///   dispose: (r) => r.cleanup(),
///   debugLabel: 'MyResource',
/// );
///
/// // When done, dispose the `raiiManager` to cleanup all managed resources
/// raiiManager.disposeLifecycle();
/// ```
///
/// For long-lived resources that should exist for the entire application lifetime,
/// use [alwaysAliveRaiiManager]:
///
/// ```dart
/// final globalResource = RaiiBox.withLifecycle(
///   alwaysAliveRaiiManager,
///   instance: MyGlobalResource(),
///   debugLabel: 'GlobalResource',
/// );
/// ```
///
/// This library serves as the foundation for more specific lifecycle management
/// implementations in Flutter widgets, controllers, and other disposable resources.
/// It provides the core abstractions that other libraries build upon to provide
/// type-safe, automatic resource management.
